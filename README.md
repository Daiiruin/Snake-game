Feel free to customize the game to your liking. You can modify the following aspects:

- **Game Speed**: Adjust the speed of the snake by changing the `speed` variable in the `script.js` file.
- **Game Over Conditions**: You can customize the conditions under which the game ends by modifying the `checkCollision` function in the `script.js` file.
- **Styling**: Customize the game's appearance by editing the CSS in the `style.css` file.
